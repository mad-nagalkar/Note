Operators 
special symbols in Python that perform operations on values and variables, known as operands

1)Arithmetic Operators(mathematical calculations)
2)Assignment Operators(Assign values to variables)
3)Comparison Operators(Compare two values)
4)Logical Operators(Combine or modify boolean expressions)
5)Identity Operators(Check if two variables refer to the same object in memory)
6)Membership Operators(Test if a value is present in a sequence)
7)Bitwise Operators(Perform operations on individual bits of data)


Arithmetic Operator
+ (addition)
- (subtraction)
* (multiplication)
/ (division)
% (modulus - remainder of division)
// (floor division - quotient without decimal part)
** (exponentiation

Assignment Operators
= (assign)
+= (add and assign)
-= (subtract and assign)
*= (multiply and assign)
/= (divide and assign)
%= (modulus and assign)
//= (floor divide and assign)
**= (exponentiate and assign)
&= (bitwise AND and assign)
|= (bitwise OR and assign)
^= (bitwise XOR and assign)
>>= (bitwise right shift and assign)
<<= (bitwise left shift and assign)

Comparison Operators
== (equal to)
!= (not equal to)
> (greater than)
< (less than)
>= (greater than or equal to)
<= (less than or equal to)

Logical Operators
is (identical)
is not (not identical)
and (logical AND)
or (logical OR)
not (logical NOT)

Identity Operators
is (identical)
is not (not identical)

Membership Operators
in (present)
not in (not present)

Bitwise Operators
& (bitwise AND)
| (bitwise OR)
^ (bitwise XOR)
~ (bitwise NOT)
<< (left shift)
>> (right shift)
