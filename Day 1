STRING

represents a sequence of characters
It is just a word or a collection of characters
Strings are immutable
Immutability: Strings in Python are immutable, meaning that concatenation always creates a new string object.
 
They are defined by enclosing characters within single quotes ('...'), double quotes ("..."), or triple quotes ("""...""" or '''...''') for multi-line strings.
		string1 = 'Hello'
		string2 = "World"
		string3 = """This is a
		multi-line string"""
		
contain letters, numbers, symbols, and spaces
Individual characters within a string can be accessed using indexing

Strings support various operations such as concatenation, slicing, and formatting.
They also have built-in methods for tasks like converting case, searching, and replacing substrings.

concatenation
process of joining two or more strings into a single, new string.
1)Using the + operator
most straightforward way
		string1 = "Hello"
		string2 = "World"
		result = string1 + " " + string2
		print(result)  # Output: Hello World


ensure that all operands are strings.
If you need to concatenate a string with a number or other data type, convert it to a string first using str().
		number = 123
		string = "The number is: " + str(number)
		print(string) # Output: The number is: 123

2)Using the join() method
particularly efficient for concatenating multiple strings
		string_list = ["Hello", " ", "World", "!"]
		result = "".join(string_list)
		print(result)  # Output: Hello World!


3)Using f-strings (formatted string literals)
Way to add expressions inside string literals
		string1 = "Hello"
		string2 = "World"
		result = f"{string1} {string2}!"
		print(result)  # Output: Hello World!

4)Using the % operator (older method)
less modern compared to f-strings and format()
		string1 = "Hello"
		string2 = "World"
		result = "%s %s!" % (string1, string2)
		print(result) # Output: Hello World!
		
5)Using the format() method
more control over string formatting and can also be used for concatenation
		 string1 = "Hello"
		 string2 = "World"
		 result = "{} {}!".format(string1, string2)
		 print(result) # Output: Hello World!


		name = "anna"
		name += " is my name"
		print(name) # Output: anna is my name

Assignment Operators
		age = 18
		age += 2   # age = age + 2
		print(age) # Output: 20


		age = 18
		age *= 2   # age = age * 2
		print(age) # Output: 36

Comparison Operators
a = 1
b = 2

a == b #False
a != b #True
a > b  #False
a <= b #True

Logical Operators/Boolean operators
Python provides three logical operators: and, or, and not. 
These operators are used to combine or modify Boolean expressions (expressions that evaluate to True or False) and return a Boolean result.

and operator:
The and operator returns True if both operands are True.
If either operand is False, the and operator returns False.
It exhibits "short-circuiting" behavior: if the first operand is False, the second operand is not evaluated.

    print(True and True)   # Output: True
    print(True and False)  # Output: False
    print(False and True)  # Output: False
    print(False and False) # Output: False

	x = 5
	y = 10
	
	# Example: Both conditions are True
	if x > 0 and y > 0:
	    print("Both x and y are positive.") # This will be printed
	
	# Example: One condition is False
	if x > 0 and y < 5:
	    print("This will not be printed.")

or operator:
The or operator returns True if at least one of the operands is True.
It returns False only if both operands are False.
It also exhibits "short-circuiting" behavior: if the first operand is True, the second operand is not evaluated.

    print(True or True)    # Output: True
    print(True or False)   # Output: True
    print(False or True)   # Output: True
    print(False or False)  # Output: False

	age = 17
	has_permission = True
	
	# Example: One condition is True
	if age >= 18 or has_permission:
	    print("Eligible to proceed.") # This will be printed
	
	# Example: Both conditions are False
	if age < 10 or has_permission == False:
	    print("This will not be printed.")

not operator:
The not operator is a unary operator, meaning it operates on a single operand.
It inverts the Boolean value of its operand: not True evaluates to False, and not False evaluates to True.
    
    print(not True)   # Output: False
    print(not False)  # Output: True

	is_raining = False
	
	# Example: Reversing a False condition
	if not is_raining:
	    print("It's not raining, go outside!") # This will be printed
	
	# Example: Reversing a True condition
	is_sunny = True
	if not is_sunny:
	    print("This will not be printed.")
These logical operators are fundamental for constructing complex conditional statements and controlling program flow in Python. They are often used within if, elif, and while statements.

Identity Operators
def is_adult(age):
	if age > 18:
		return True
	else:
		return False

def is_adult2(age)
	return True if age > 18 else False

Python identity operators are used to check if two variables refer to the exact same object in memory, rather than just having equal values. 
This distinction is crucial when working with mutable objects or when needing to confirm that two references point to the identical instance. 

There are two identity operators in Python: 
is: This operator returns True if both variables point to the same object in memory. Otherwise, it returns False.
	    a = [1, 2, 3]
	    b = a  # b now refers to the same list object as a
	    c = [1, 2, 3] # c is a new list object, even if its content is the same
	
	    print(a is b)  # Output: True (a and b are the same object)
	    print(a is c)  # Output: False (a and c are different objects)	

is not: This operator returns True if both variables do not point to the same object in memory. Otherwise, it returns False. 
	    x = "hello"
	    y = "world"
	    z = "hello"
	
	    print(x is not y)  # Output: True (x and y are different objects)
	    print(x is not z)  # Output: False (x and z might be the same object due to string interning for small strings)

Key Difference from Equality Operators (==):
While is checks for object identity (same memory location), the equality operator == checks for value equality. Two objects can have the same value but be distinct objects in memory.

	list1 = [1, 2, 3]
	list2 = [1, 2, 3]
	
	print(list1 == list2) # Output: True (values are equal)
	print(list1 is list2) # Output: False (different objects in memory)

Common Use Cases:
Checking for None: The is operator is the recommended way to check if a variable is None, as None is a singleton object in Python

	    my_variable = None
	    if my_variable is None:
	        print("Variable is None")

Comparing Custom Objects:
When working with instances of custom classes, is can determine if two variables refer to the exact same instance.
Performance Optimization (with caution):
In some specific cases, using is for immutable objects like small integers or strings that are "interned" by Python can be slightly faster than ==, but relying on interning behavior across different Python versions or implementations is generally not recommended for robust code.

Indexing
accessing elements in a sequence (like strings, lists, or tuples) using their position
Indexing starts at 0, meaning the first element has index 0, the second has index 1, and so on.
Negative indices are also supported, where -1 refers to the last element, -2 to the second last, and so on. 


Basic Indexing
To access an element, use square brackets [] with the index inside,
		my_list = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
		print(my_list[0])  # Output: 10
		print(my_list[3])  # Output: 40
		print(my_list[-1]) # Output: 50

Slicing
Slicing extracts a portion of a sequence(strings, lists, and tuples) using a start and end index.
	syntax [start:end:step]
	start specifies the starting index (default is 0).
	end specifies the ending index (exclusive).
	step specifies the increment between indices (default is 1).
	
		my_list = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

		print(my_list[2:5])    # Output: [2, 3, 4]
		print(my_list[:4])    # Output: [0, 1, 2, 3]
		print(my_list[6:])    # Output: [6, 7, 8, 9]
		print(my_list[1:7:2])  # Output: [1, 3, 5]
		print(my_list[::2])   # Output: [0, 2, 4, 6, 8]
		print(my_list[::-1])  # Output: [9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0] - Reverses the list

If start is omitted, it defaults to 0. If end is omitted, it defaults to the length of the sequence.
The syntax is [start:end], where start is inclusive and end is exclusive.
		my_string = "Hello, World!"
		print(my_string[0:5])  # Output: Hello
		print(my_string[7:])  # Output: World!
		print(my_string[:5])  # Output: Hello
		print(my_string[:])   # Output: Hello, World!

Index method
The index() method finds the index of the first occurrence of a value in a sequence.
		my_list = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
		index_of_banana = my_list.index('banana')
		print(index_of_banana)  # Output: 1
